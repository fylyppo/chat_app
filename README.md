# chat_app

A chat_app project created in Flutter using Provider and CloudFirestore. It supports mobile and it's almost fully working (the exception is the lack of selection of a group photo).

## Getting Started

The chat_app allows user to create group chats, send and read messages within the group. After you sign up with avatar, email address, username and password you will be able to create a group with group name and other users which you can add by searching them by username. Then you are good to go! You can messaging with other group members and seeing who has seen which message.
